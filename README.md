Game of Thrones fans rejoice: Hodor-lang
is Hodor hodor hodor. The engineers
behind this project say they wanted to
focus on creating disruptive technology
that just plain works. “Using jumbled
permutations of the word ‘hodor’ over
and over again we have simplified
programming syntax to make it easier
than ever before”.
